PROBLEMS USUALLY IN DAILY LIFE:
At a normal traffic signal:
Every road gets fixed green time.
Even if one road is empty and another is jammed.
Emergency vehicles get stuck.

FPGA is chosen instead of a microcontroller because:
FPGA ADVANTAGES : 
Parallel processing → checks density & emergency at the same time.
Zero software delay.
Deterministic behavior (no crashes, no OS).
Immediate response to emergency.

One-Line Purpose of This Design is :
This FPGA module controls a 4-road junction using minimum traffic phases, adapts green time using vehicle sensors, and gives instant priority to emergency and pedestrians.

In this we have used/ tried to implement the Minimum Number of Ways to Clear Traffic in One Complete Cycle i.e.Four ways (four traffic phases)

At a four-road intersection, vehicles can move in two basic directions:
1.) Straight
2.) Turning (left/right)
However, all vehicles cannot move at the same time because their paths intersect, which would cause collisions. Therefore, traffic movements must be grouped carefully so that only non-conflicting vehicles move together.

The entire traffic at the junction is cleared in one complete cycle by dividing vehicle movement into four non-conflicting groups:
Way 1: North and South Turning Movements
Vehicles from the north and south turn simultaneously.
These movements do not intersect with each other.
Turning traffic is cleared first.

Way 2: North and South Straight Movements
Vehicles from the north and south move straight together.
No conflict occurs because both move in the same axis.
This clears straight traffic in the north–south direction.

Way 3: East and West Turning Movements
Vehicles from the east and west perform turning movements together.
These movements are non-conflicting.
Turning traffic in the east–west direction is cleared.

Way 4: East and West Straight Movements
Vehicles from the east and west move straight at the same time.
This completes the clearance of straight traffic in the east–west direction.

After these four ways, all possible vehicle movements at the intersection have been served once, which completes one full traffic cycle.
