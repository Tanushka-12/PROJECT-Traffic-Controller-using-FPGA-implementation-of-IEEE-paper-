# PROJECT-Traffic-Controller-using-FPGA-implementation-of-IEEE-paper-
FPGA-based traffic controllers in IEEE papers focus on adaptive, real-time systems using VHDL/Verilog for smart signal changes based on vehicle density (sensors like IR/ultrasonic), reducing congestion and prioritizing emergencies (ambulances).
